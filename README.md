## 📥 Using Releases

If you prefer a pre-built version, you can download executables directly from the [Releases](https://github.com/officiallyaninja/Number-Jumbler-DX/releases) page:

* Choose the release compatible with your operating system.
* Download and extract the executable.
* Run the executable directly from your terminal or command prompt

## 🎮 How to Play

* You are given an arithmetic expression with unknown variables represented by question marks (e.g., `?-?+?`).
* Your task is to fill in the question marks with numbers.
* After entering numbers, you’ll see the result of the expression.
* Use the result as a hint to deduce the correct values of each variable.
* Keep guessing and solving until you've correctly identified all the variables!
